The Austin Health hospital in Heidelberg, in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, mistakenly sent out a fax to more than 200 patients saying they had died. Fortunately, the mistake was realised within hours, and Austin Health contacted each GP to alert them to the mistake and to apologise. Austin Health (left) accidentally writes off more than 200 patients as dead by sending death notices to their family doctors . It's believed GPs were alerted to the error before they had a chance to contact families, but in one case a doctor did call a family member to express their condolences. Austin health sent this letter to GPs stating their patients had died whilst an inpatient at the hospital. The health service has since apologised for the mistake . The blunder was put down to human error and came when a computer file was saved to the wrong location, substituting the death notice for the standard patient discharge form. Austin Heath communications director Taryn Sheehy said, 'Austin Health automatically notifies GPs when their patients are discharged from hospital. 'Notifications sent in the early hours of Wednesday, 30th July, incorrectly advised GPs that their patients, who had been discharged the previous day from the Austin Hospital, had died.' Ms Sheehy said 'we apologise unreservedly to affected clinics who, for the most part, were very understanding about the error.' The mix-up was not linked to the hospital's recent introduction of a new booking system, she said, and at no times did it impact on patient care . A number of GPs in Victoria have accidentally been sent death notices of their patients by Austin Health which has been blamed on human error . Dr. Tony Bartone, president of the Victorian branch of the Australian Medical Association, said the major blunder was just unacceptable. 'IT issues must not undermine patient care or trust in the Victorian healthcare system. Many of these GPs have long relationships with these patients and their families. It would have been distressing to receive such a fax, especially relating to the unexpected death of children and teenagers. It is unacceptable for failings like this to happen.' 'This serves to underline the importance of a strong and robust, state-wide IT health system. Victorians are still being denied this necessary resource.' GPs have been apologised to after Austin Health accidentally sent out death notices regarding their patients . The Victorian Labor Opposition has also weighed in and says the incident is a further sign of a hospital system in crisis. 'They obviously can't take that back, it's symptomatic of a health system that is in crisis, a health system where emergency departments are full,' said Labor leader Daniel Andrews in Melbourne. 'You talk to any nurses, any doctor, any paramedic, any patient or their loved ones, and they'll tell you that we shouldn't settle for the health system the way it is now.'</td>\n",

A former paratrooper has paid back £5 he borrowed from a friend 50 years ago - with £170 interest. David ‘Taffy’ Keegan lost touch with Victor Allin after they left the armed forces - but he never forgot the money 74-year-old Mr Allin lent him in 1964, and paid up as soon as they made contact again. And to make amends Mr Keegan, 73, of Sydney, Australia, sent his old friend - a great-grandfather of four from Kennington, Kent, a cheque for more than £170 - calculated at 7 per cent annual interest. Happy: Victor Allin and his wife Margaret with the cheque for £175  they were sent in payment of a £5 debt . It arrived in a Christmas card with . the note: ‘Please accept the enclosed £5 at 7 per cent compound interest . over 51 years in the spirit in which it is offered. Have a nice meal on . your interest.’ Mr Allin, . who also has 12 grandchildren, said: ‘It was such a nice shock. I’m . pleased Taffy has now salved his conscience, as he told me that it often . played on his mind.’ The two men met in 1958 when they both served with the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment. The . pair served in Cyprus, Germany, France and Bahrain, where their . aircraft was blown up on the runway by angry locals and their soup . poisoned by a rogue chef. They lost contact in 1964 and Mr Keegan moved to Sydney, where he has lived ever since. But they got back in touch last year. 'Have a nice meal': Mr Keegan sent the cheque for more than £170 in a Christmas card with this note . The . former comrades only made contact when the Allins decided to look Mr . Keegan up when they were on holiday in Prestatyn, North Wales, last year . - as they knew he had once lived there. Mr . Allin said: ‘We found the address for a Keegan and we went to see him. We asked if he knew David, and he told us it was his brother. ‘He . gave me quite a scare because he said we were 40 years too late. We . thought he had died! But it turned out he had moved away many years . ago.’ After inviting them . in, Mr Keegan's brother, John, immediately spoke David via Skype in . Sydney, to tell him his old friend had come to visit. Mr Allin said: ‘He came on the phone and the first words he said to me were “I still owe you a fiver”. I had no memory of it.’ Then and now: Mr Allin (left in left photo) and Mr Keegan (right in left) pictured during their time serving in the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment. Mr Keegan is also pictured now (right) Mr Keegan said he had needed to borrow the money because he was ‘absolutely skint’. He . said: ‘Vic was flush with funds which I suspect could only have been . amassed from a game of poker or a successful visit to the White City . greyhounds. ‘As our pay at . the time was four pound ten shillings plus an extra eight shillings a . week for jumping out of planes, you can imagine what the ten pounds he . lent me meant at the time.’ ‘I . managed to repay Vic half of what I owed him in 1964, leaving a fiver . to be repaid at a later date. Time marched on and as often happens . between good mates we lost touch with each other. ‘We . have stayed in touch since and I am looking forward to shaking his hand . when I visit him and his wife later this month whilst on my way to . Paris. ‘The idea of facing . him still owing him a fiver was too embarrassing, so I decided to repay . him with interest before I arrived in Ashford.’ Going up: The cheque was sent from Australia for more than £170 - calculated at 7 per cent annual interest . In . his Christmas card to Mr Allin, Mr Keegan also wrote: ‘When I left for . Paris in 1962 I owed you £10. I repaid a fiver when I saw you in . Aldershot in 1964 on my way to Tokyo for the 1964 Games.’ Mr Allin says he will spend his interest on a meal for the pair at the Eastwell Manor Hotel in Kent. 'Please accept the enclosed £5 at 7 per cent compound interest over 51 years in the spirit in which it is offered. Have a nice meal on your interest' David Keegan's note . He . added: ‘I'm really looking forward to seeing him. It is an exciting . time. It will probably be the one and only time we see each other again. The cheque was a by-product really, the best thing is that we're now . back in touch.’ Mr Keegan, who has lived in Sydney since 1973, added that he had always felt guilty about the debt. He said: ‘Many is the time I woke worrying about owing a good mate a loan given without hesitation when I most needed it. ‘Imagine . my surprise when I worked out that £5 at compound interest over the . time meant I had to repay Vic one hundred and seventy pounds and seventy . five pence. ‘I suppose the moral of the story is, don’t wait 50 years to repay an old mate a fiver.’</td>\n",

NASCAR racer Brad Keselowski drove right into the heart of the Twitterati during Monday's delayed Daytona 500 by tweeting from his car and picking up over 100,000 Twitter followers in the process. Before the race, Keselowski had about . 65,000 followers on the social networking site. About 24 hours later, he . had more than 212,000. He started by posting a photo of his view of the incident where a jet-dryer truck that erupted in a fireball after it was hit by driver Juan Pablo Montoya with 40 laps remaining.

Trailblazer: Keselowski's interactive approach to the race was not only a hit with the thousands of fans who followed his tweets but some of his rivals . The 28-year-old tweeted quick . reactions to incidents in the race and shared his phone with . fellow drivers during the two-hour break as the track was cleared of the . truck. 'Nothing we could do there,' he posted. 'Never saw the wreck till we were windshield deep.' Twitter in the driver's seat: Brad Keselowski went from 52,000 Twitter followers to well over 212,000 as he from the track . He also interacted with fans and posted various musings about the delayed race. The Dodge driver took advantage of several breaks in the race to keep his followers updated. After a brief lapse in tweets, he told a concerned fan: 'Still here bs-ing w other drivers'. Most . professional sports ban competitors from tweeting during events but . NASCAR, keen to make ground in social media, has taken a more lenient . attitude. Keselowski's interactive approach was not only a hit with the thousands of fans who followed his tweets but his rivals also approved. 'Time to get back racing, thank you for following!,' Keselowski wrote. 'That's how Brad is. That's what he makes and what he enjoys,' runner up Dale Earnhardt Jr told reporters. 'I thought it was pretty funny.' Keselowski finished 32nd in the race won by Matt Kenseth after being involved in a group collision late in the race. 'Nothing we could do there... never saw the wreck till we were windshield deep,' he tweeted. Everything that could go wrong with NASCAR's marquee race, which finished last night, did. Speed: Keselowski, top, finished in 32nd place in the Daytona 500 on Monday night, a race delayed several times due to rain and a massive fire on the track . Victory: Matt Kenseth capped a crazy 36 hours for NASCAR by winning the first postponed Daytona 500 in 55 editions of the marquee event . Journeyman . driver Dave Blaney was leading when a problem with Juan Pablo Montoya's . car sent him spinning under caution into a safety truck. The truck, which holds 200 gallons of jet kerosene, burst into flames. Montoya's car slid into the grass, and he gingerly climbed from it as fire trucks rushed to the scene. The inferno raged on, and NASCAR red-flagged the race with 40 laps remaining. Blaze: Safety crews try to extinguish a fire from a jet dryer after it was hit by Juan Pablo Montoya during the Daytona 500 . Rescue: The driver of the jet dryer is helped down the track as leaking fuel bursts into flames after being hit by Juan Pablo Montoya . Safe: Juan Pablo Montoya walks from his burning car after it collided with a track-drying truck during the NASCAR Daytona 500 auto race . NASCAR officials were examining the track surface to determine whether the race could continue. 'About the time you think you've seen about everything, you see something like this,' NASCAR president Mike Helton said. 'I . think we, like everybody else, would like to see this race finished. This is within reason, and we think we can do that within reason. 'We've waited this long. Another 30 minutes is worth trying to finish the 40 laps.' Jet fuel poured down the surface of Turn 3 at Daytona International Speedway after the accident, creating a fiery lasting image of NASCAR's biggest race of the year.

Battling the blaze: Safety workers try to extinguish a fire from a jet dryer after it was hit by Juan Pablo Montoya, grinding the Daytona 500 to a halt . The clean-up crews were using boxes of Tide laundry detergent to clean up the fuel. It . was par for the course for this Daytona 500, which had already been postponed for . the first time in NASCAR's 54-year history because of steady rain all . day Sunday at the track. NASCAR . initially planned to restart the race at noon Monday, but persistent . rain forced series officials to make an early decision to hold off until . 7pm. What's the damage? Montoya's team looks over his wrecked car after he collided with a jet dryer truck during the Daytona 500 . Speaking out: Juan Pablo Montoya talks to reporters after the massive crash . Carl Edwards, who fell just short of . winning the title last season, started from the pole with champion Tony . Stewart, seeking to snap an 0-for-13 losing streak in the Daytona 500, . right behind him. Danica Patrick, making the full-time move to NASCAR from IndyCar, was making her Daytona 500 debut. Those storylines, however, were quickly forgotten in this bizarre 55th running of NASCAR's version of the Super Bowl. It took several minutes for safety workers to put out the fire, and then came the task of removing the truck from the track and cleaning up all that spilled fuel. Rinse, repeat: The clean-up crews were using boxes of Tide laundry detergent and a lot of water to clean up the fuel on the track at the Daytona International Speedway . Towing the truck from the steep . banking presented a challenge, as NASCAR was nervous any movement would . dig into the track surface. Montoya, who said his helmet was singed in the fire and his foot ached, said he felt a vibration in his car before the accident. 'I've . hit a lot of things - but a jet dryer?' he said. 'It just felt really . strange, and as I was talking on the radio, the car just turned right.' The drivers were allowed to exit their cars after about 10 minutes under the red flag. Red-flagged: The race was halted with just 40 laps to go as firefighters battled the flames erupting from the jet dryer . Trouble on the track: Danica Patrick (right), Kurt Busch (left), David Ragan (second from left) and Jimmie Johnson (second from right) crashed into each other shortly after the race began . The racing was aggressive at the drop of the green flag, and the first accident occurred on just the second lap, when Elliott Sadler ran into the back of Jimmie Johnson as they drafted around the track. The contact sent Johnson into the wall, and as the five-time NASCAR champion slid back down across the track, he was hit hard in the door by David Ragan. The accident collected six cars total, including defending Daytona 500 winner Trevor Bayne and Danica Patrick. 'I'm just really, really bummed to start the season this way,' Johnson said. 'To work as hard as everyone did at Hendrick Motorsports to get this Lowe's Chevrolet and to have it barely complete two-and-a-half miles of green flag racing is pretty sad. We'll just go on and go to Phoenix and set our marks on winning that race.'

              "      <td>(CNN) -- The Amazon rainforest is so vast and full of life that even its defenders don't know exactly what it is they are protecting. In the past 40 years, roughly 20 percent of the Amazon rainforest has been wiped out. \"The wealth of biodiversity is so immense, we cannot even estimate the amount we don't know,\" says Cláudio C. Maretti, Brazil-based director for conservation for the World Wildlife Fund. \"Every new expedition you do to the Amazon, you might find one new species of fish. Every other, you might find some new bird or frog.\" The Amazon rainforest, which encompasses an area nearly as large as the continental United States and stretches across nine countries, is considered the world's richest and most varied natural habitat, with several million species of insects, plants, birds and fish calling it home. It also plays an important role in regulating Earth's temperature as its dense vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the air. But the Amazon has been under pressure from outside forces for decades. In the past 40 years, roughly 20 percent of the rainforest has been wiped out. Maretti says an additional 17 percent has been degraded to varying degrees. \"We have been deforesting at enormous rates,\" Maretti says. The chief drivers of this deforestation are large-scale business interests involved in logging, mining, agriculture and, especially, cattle ranching. Some of this activity is sanctioned by the government; much of it is not. Greenpeace estimates as much as 80 percent of the logging is illegal. The Amazon rainforest is just one of many habitats around the world threatened by encroaching development or natural resource extraction. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimates that 50,000 square miles of forest -- more than three times the size of Switzerland -- are lost each year because of clearing and degradation. The threat is particularly acute in the more tropical areas of South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. Cambodia, for example, lost nearly 30 percent of its primary forests from 2000 to 2005, according to FAO. Vietnam lost close to 55 percent of its primary forests, FAO found. And Nigeria lost nearly 56 percent of its primary forests over the same period, the worst rate of forest loss in the world, according to FAO. The destruction of the Earth's oldest and richest forests is not a new phenomenon, but the rate of destruction has increased in recent decades. \"Worldwide, one-half of all forests we've lost in the last 10,000 years has occurred in the last 80 years. Half of that was destroyed in the last 30 years,\" says Scott Paul, Forest Campaign Coordinator for Greenpeace. Paul says the chief driver of forest destruction is the buying and selling of forest products and farm products in the international market, not to meet local needs. \"The timber market, and also for agriculture, mining: When it plugs into the international economic system, that's when you've got to watch it,\" he says. Paul would like to see a certification system so that consumers know the source and conditions under which the product they're consuming was harvested. \"If you buy wine and cheese, we can tell the region and the year. But forest products have always been cut in remote and distant areas and thrown in a pipe and spit out on the other side. There is no way to determine if something came from a well-managed forest or an illegal forest where there is slavery, murder, drug trade, etc.,\" he says. While the story of the world's old-growth forests would appear to be one of unremitting destruction, forests lost to logging and agriculture are actually growing back in some areas, such as the northeast region of the United States and parts of Europe. This thrills some wildlife advocates who would like to see the restoration of exiled or decimated species. \"Northern New England is the only place in the eastern United States where you have the potential for large-scale wilderness where wolves, lynxes, cougars, woodland caribou and salmon rivers could be restored,\" according to Michael J. Kellett, executive director of RESTORE: The North Woods. \"We could literally have almost the entire ecosystem of the Maine woods as it once was.\" With large-scale agriculture all but gone from New England and logging companies concentrating their attention elsewhere, Kellett's biggest fear is that real estate development could begin to carve up the vast forests of Maine. His proposed solution: create a national park. In Brazil in recent years, the government reportedly has stepped up efforts to slow the Amazon's destruction. Last October, Brazil said the rate of deforestation plunged 41 percent because of the enforcement of environmental laws. Environmental groups say the drop also was caused by the fall of soy prices and the rise of Brazil's currency against the dollar, making the country's exports more expensive. The World Wildlife Fund's Maretti is hopeful that Brazil, with international help, will be able to protect even more of the Amazon, an area he considers among the most vital natural habitats in the world. \"We do have strong civil society. We do have more governance,\" Maretti says. \"But we certainly need support from abroad. I don't believe Brazil can do this job alone.\" E-mail to a friend .</td>\n",

              "      <td>(CNN) -- The Cannes Film festival, which kicked off Wednesday on the French Riviera, is an Olympics of cinema, where endurance matters as much as victory to the 30,000 industry insiders who attend each year. The festival was conceived in the late 1930s as a reaction against Italian dictator Benito Mussolini promoting fascist-Italian and national-socialist German films at the Venice Film Festival. Its first edition, planned in September 1939, was delayed by war till 1946 but its ideals remained the same: to show films from all over the world without prejudice of any sort. But today Cannes jostles in the crowded film industry schedules with other A-list events: Toronto (and Venice) act as Fall launchpads for the following year's awards season, while Sundance is at the vanguard of independent cinema and new talent. Meanwhile the Oscars are considered by many as the supreme accolade of the movie business. Cannes still regards itself as the grande dame of film events the world over -- but does it still matter? The festival, which this year celebrates its 67th edition, stands firmly apart -- and, some would argue, above -- the rest of the crowd. This comes in part from its original ambition, as put by the festival's first president, poet Jean Cocteau: \"The Cannes Film Festival is an apolitical no man's land, a microcosm of what the world would be like if people could make direct contact with one another and speak the same language.\" For Cannes is to cinema what the motto \"liberte, egalite, fraternite\" (\"liberty, egality, fraternity\") is to France: an aspiration, an ideal, an inclusive forum for all talents, old and new, coming from all over the world, and motivated by one common love: films. Without prejudices. In its early years Cannes was nothing more than a social event where stars mingled on the red carpet. Everyone smiled for the camera and everyone went home happy as almost every film received some kind of an award. Then, Cannes raised its game. First came the Palme d'Or, its top award, given in 1955 and rivaling the Oscars as the most prestigious prize in the film industry. In 1972, the festival declared its independence by setting up its own selection committee: until then, each country had chosen the films which would represent them at Cannes, as still happens with the Oscars' best foreign film category. The selection of features became more discerning, the awards became fewer in number -- and success at the festival became ever more elusive. But if the Cannes glamor of the 1950s and 1960s lingers still, the festival's reputation for passion and controversy has only increased. The entertainment industry is notorious for controlling its sometimes unruly talents, with PR agencies operating like war machines and publicity a matter of life and death at the box office. In contrast Cannes is a unique place for unleashing imagination and wildness. The mix of glamor and high art, frivolity and seriousness combine to make Cannes a temple to cinema like no other. For Cannes is where directors will throw tantrums and tell critics to go to hell in no uncertain terms; where the winner of the Palme d'Or can be booed, as happened to film-maker Maurice Pialat in 1987 when he collected the coveted prize for \"Under the Sun;\" and where a talent like Danish maverick Lars Von Trier can express sympathy at a press conference for Adolf Hitler, then apologize, then be kicked out of the festival by the organizers (he later withdrew his apology). It is also an event which has always embraced the times. In 1968, while students in Paris were rioting and building barricades, the enfants terribles of the French New Wave -- including François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard -- canceled the awards ceremony and turned the festival into a giant marketplace. In 2004, Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" -- which criticized U.S. foreign policy -- became the first documentary to win the Palme d'Or from a festival jury which numbered more Americans than French. For directors and actors, success at Cannes is the Nobel Prize that they secretly covet. And for the 2,500 or so film critics -- who for 12 days start watching their first film at 8am and their last one just after midnight -- it is the most frantic and rewarding time, when masterpieces are seen for the first time and talents speak freely.
