He had about four seconds of his life and all that was left that he could do was to throw himself on top of them and he was blown to smithereens.\"\\nAccording to Henry Bell, it was the political situation at the time, combined with the enthusiasm of some at the college, that would have convinced so many to join the fighting.\\n\"The principal of the college at the time, Frances Forth, was very heavily involved with the military.\\n\"He would've probably held meetings in this hall encouraging boys in those heady days of 1914 to go off and fight for their king and country.\\n\"And, remember, there was a heightened tension here about the Home Rule bill and people feeling that fighting for king and country would actually stop Home Rule.\\n\"So, in a way, it (the photos) is part very much of the history not just of the war but what was happening here politically between 1912 and 1914.\"\\nWhile the old college building has taken on new life, this photographic memory of those who fought at the Somme and elsewhere now rests with their families and historians for generations to come.</td>\n",

However, Smith feels the gap between the Emirates outfit and league leaders Chelsea is already insurmountable after 14 matches, despite Arsene Wenger's belief that they can still overhaul Jose Mourinho's side.

The Blues are unbeaten this season and sit top of the table on 36 points - 13 ahead of their bitter London rivals - and the former England striker is adamant Arsenal must set their sights lower and focus on achieving qualification for the Champions League next season. Speaking on TalkSPORT's Hawksbee and Jacobs show, the 1988-89 and 1990-91 First Division winner with Arsenal said: 'I can see them having a good run, they have done it in years gone by, but I can't see them getting the kind of results that give them that proper belief that they are title challengers. 'I think they are a better team going forward now, without question, but you look back to their defensive weaknesses and think of the Anderlecht game, the Swansea game, the Man United game and have they erased it from their game? 'We will have to see when they come up against better opposition in the months to come. I don't see them as a title-challenging team. 'They will finish in the top four, no danger. I think them and Manchester United will be vying for those third and fourth places, but I cannot see them getting to the level of Chelsea.'

Correspondent Peter Greste, Bureau Chief Mohamed Fahmy, producer Baher Mohamed and cameraman Mohamed Fawzy were taken into custody Sunday evening in Cairo, the network said. The Egyptian Interior Ministry said on its Facebook page that security forces arrested a Muslim Brotherhood member and an Australian journalist at a Cairo hotel. Greste, an Australian, previously worked for CNN, Reuters and the BBC. The ministry said the Muslim Brotherhood member used the hotel to meet with other members and as a media center to broadcast damaging news about the government for Al Jazeera. The network demanded the journalists be released. Calling the arrests arbitrary, Al Jazeera said the network \"has been subject to harassment by Egyptian security forces,\" including having its equipment confiscated and offices raided, despite the network not being banned from working in Egypt. The arrests occurred the day before the Committee to Protect Journalists issued a report saying Egypt, Syria and Iraq have become the deadliest countries for journalists. Seventy journalists were killed in 2013, with six of those deaths in Egypt, the CPJ said. Egypt's current round of political turmoil began when former President Mohamed Morsy was removed from office in a July 3 coup. Last week, the military-backed government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. Police and members of the Muslim Brotherhood have clashed in the streets since then.</td>\n",

Sydney free-standing home prices, including terraces, were significantly higher than other capital cities, with prices in Melbourne hitting $646,500, $547,200 in Brisbane and $485,700 in Adelaide . Separate figures from SQM Research has shown the median home price in Sydney hit $1.005 million this week. 'Right now it would be impossible to purchase a free standing house in Sydney’s inner ring for under a million dollars, and will become increasingly difficult to purchase a free standing house in Sydney’s middle ring for under a million dollars,' Managing Director of SQM Research, Louis Christopher, said. Sydney free-standing home prices, including terraces, were significantly higher than other capital cities, with the median price of a home in Melbourne hitting $646,500, $547,200 in Brisbane and $485,700 in Adelaide.

The inner west eight bedroom home has five bathrooms and a whopping six car spaces . The $1 million price tag is 7.2 percent higher than this time last year and 22 percent higher than three years ago. The median asking price for units in Sydney sits at $569,000. It comes as a new survey by ME Bank showed 26 percent of young Australians believed they will never be able to afford to buy their own home.

ME Bank General Manager Asset Products, Luke Easton said it's a sign of how challenging housing affordability has become for many Australians. 'A large group of young people are delaying or ruling out home ownership altogether,' Mr Easton said. He said the financial challenges faced by first home buyers, including some of the highest property prices in the world, were forcing young buyers to be creative in their pursuits for the 'great Australian dream.'</td>\n",

Despite privacy concerns and fears the data could be stolen by hackers, the parent company of Alaska Airlines is testing a system that uses fingerprint scans to identify travellers with the goal of using it to speed up the process of getting from the check-in counter to the gate. If the ‘e-thumb’ system is implemented, the Seattle-based airline would become the first in the US to use biometrics for things such as boarding passes, entry into airport lounges or in-flight purchases, Bloomberg reported. Pioneer: Alaska Airlines could become the first carrier in the US to use biometrics to identify travellers . Fingerprint scans could replace government-issued identification documents such as passports or driver’s licences to reduce queues. Alaska Air Group began using the technology, which uses human physical characteristics to identify a person, at a frequent flier lounge in Seattle in August. The pilot project does not store images but uses an algorithm that converts reference points on a fingerprint into an encrypted code that cannot reconstruct the original image, Bloomberg reported. But the Electronic Frontier Foundation said the technology poses significant risks for privacy and security, and could be vulnerable to hackers. Under your thumb: Fingerprint scans could be used as boarding passes or to gain access into an airport lounge . The system faces a few hurdles before it can be implemented for commercial use. It must go through rigorous approval process and Alaska Air must convince the Transportation Security Administration and other aviation authorities that the system cannot be defeated and personal information will be kept safe and secure. Sandy Stelling, Alaska Airlines’ managing director for customer research and development, told Bloomberg: ‘We’re already in discussions of how we extend this, where we go next. Is it the boarding door? Is it the bag drop? ‘Obviously we have to line up a number of partnerships to make that happen. The customer response has been that strong. We don’t want to take our foot off the gas.’ UK arrivals with biometric visas or biometric residence permits must submit to a fingerprint scan . Fingerprint scans are not unusual in airports. Currently in the UK, passengers with biometric visas or biometric residence permits must submit to a fingerprint scan when they arrive at passport control. A similar program is used in the US. Passengers who are flying between the UK and Ireland require a facial biometric image to verify their identity. In 2008, the former British Airports Authority was forced to scrap plans to take fingerprints of passengers using London Heathrow’s Terminal 5 following warnings that such checks could be illegal. BAA had planned to fingerprint both domestic and international travellers transferring to domestic flights at Heathrow. That same year, Scandinavian Airlines began allowing passengers with luggage to board domestic flights with a scan of their index finger.</td>\n",

A council is investigating why swastikas are carved into the stonework of its offices after a member of the public spotted the masonry 75 years after the building was built. A row of the infamous Nazi symbols adorn part of the stone façade above a door at Essex County Hall in Chelmsford, which was completed in 1939, the year the Second World War started. A member of the public wrote to the council asking why it 'was still commissioned given the symbol's negative connotations.' A county council has been asked to explain why the front of its HQ is decorated with swastikas . They added: 'It struck me as strange seeing as the Nazi party formed in 1933 and by March 1938 were beginning an invasion into Austria. 'It's potentially offensive and upsetting to those that lost loved ones in the war or those that fought for their country.' The council is dealing with the request for an explanation under the Freedom of Information Act. A spokesman said: 'We will be responding in detail to the individual who has raised the questions before making any further comment.' John Hammond of the Chelmsford Civic . Society questioned why the request for an explanation was being made 75 . years after the building was constructed. He said: 'I'm mystified as to why it's coming up now. Personally I think it would be overkill to remove the symbols.' A row of the infamous Nazi symbols are on the stone façade above a door at Essex County Hall in Chelmsford - completed in 1939, the year the Second World War started. A member of the public wrote to the council asking for an explanation . The swastika was used for thousands of years, including a Hindu symbol, before it was adopted by Hitler. The Grade II-listed building was constructed between 1929 to 1939 - the decade of the Nazis' rise to power. The hall 'strongly represents the civic pride and authority of a county council', according to English Heritage. In addition to the controversial swastika carvings, the exterior is decorated with Corinthian columns and other details. The building is particularly noted for its interior fixtures and fittings, including stained glass windows and murals by prominent local artists. The swastika is an ancient symbol whose history stretched back for millennia before its meaning was perverted by Nazi ideology. It is used to represent luck in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, and takes its name - meaning 'it is good' from the Sanskrit language in which the Hindu religious texts were written. Many Hindus traditionally painted the swastika symbol over their doors during festivals in order to welcome the gods inside. As well as Asian religions, the swastika has been a popular decorative motif in Greek, Roman, Celtic and Byzantine art, making it one of the most common symbols in human history. However, in 1920 Adolf Hitler declared that the swastika - tilted 45 degrees - should be the official logo of his nascent Nazi Party. When he came to power, he replaced the German flag with a swastika in a white circle on a red background, making the emblem a feared symbol of his murderous regime. After the Second World War the Nazi swastika was outlawed in Germany, Poland, Hungary and Lithuania, although it is still permitted in a religious or scholarly context.</td>\n",

Fiber helps move material through your digestive tract and also adds bulk to your bowel movements, but of which can help regulate your bowels.Though your diet should include a solid mix of both, dietary fiber comes in two forms—soluble and insoluble.Soluble dietary fiber means that the fiber is water soluble, the mix of which creates a gel-like substance that can help promote the movement of material through your bowels. Since this fiber absorbs water, it also cuts down on runny stools by solidifying them. Foods rich in soluble fiber include oats, peas, beans (navy, pinto, black, kidney), apples, citrus fruits, carrots, barley, and psyllium.Insoluble fiber is not water soluble, so it helps add bulk to stool, which helps maintain regular movement of your bowels. Foods rich in insoluble fiber include whole wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts (pecans, almonds, Brazil nuts), beans, and vegetables (such as cauliflower, green beans, leafy greens, and potatoes).Your suggested amount of daily fiber depends on your sex and age. Men and women age 50 and under should aim for 38 and 25 grams per day, respectively. Men and women over age 50 should consume 30 and 21 grams per day, respectively.;\\n, Many common foods are very low in fiber. Relying on a diet too heavy in these foods can lead to irregularity, so you should always balance them with high-fiber options. Foods low in dietary fiber include:Cheese (and other dairy such as ice cream)\\nMeat\\nProcessed foods such as fast food, hot dogs, or microwave dinners\\n\\n, If you have any dietary restrictions due to a medical condition, then it is important to discuss these with your doctor. You may require a nutritional consult to ensure that you are following a balanced diet and to help keep you regular.\\n You should aim to drink two to three liters of fluid each day.While most of your fluid should come from water, you can also include fruit and vegetable juices, as well as clear soup broths to meet your daily requirements.Some medical conditions (such as congestive heart failure) will require you to restrict your fluid intake.Consult your doctor regarding your acceptable level of fluid intake before making any changes if you have a condition where you fluids have been restricted.\\nDehydration is also associated with a condition known as “retentive constipation,” especially in children.With this condition, initial constipation due to dry, hardened stool is worsened by stagnating in the colon/rectum where additional water is drawn out, hardening it even further. This can lead to a vicious cycle of irregularity.\\n The lactic-acid producing bacteria (LAB) found in yogurt has been shown in studies to assist with regularity for some gastrointestinal conditions, including constipation and some diarrheal diseases.The most commonly studied strains of LAB are Lactobacillus and Streptococcus.Check the label on the brand of yogurt for the presence of these LAB strains.\\n You can also purchase over-the-counter fiber supplements to help regulate your bowel movements. Some of the most common are products containing psyllium (such as Metamucil), which is a good source of soluble fiber.</td>\n",

              "      <td>If your dog's breath is worse than usual, it could be a sign that your dog has dental disease. With dental disease, bacteria and infected tissue can exude a putrid smell once it has developed quite a bit.Dogs can have bad breath for a wide variety of reasons. The key is to identify when the smell changes or becomes markedly worse.;\\n, If your dog is pawing at its mouth or jaw, that is a sign that it may have a dental infection. If it is having a hard time eating, that may also be a sign that there is a problem in its mouth. These are behavioral clues that you need to do some investigation in your dog's mouth.Do not let your dog suffer by ignoring signs it is in pain. If a dog is showing its pain outwardly, it usually means that the dog is in pretty bad pain. Most dogs are good at hiding pain, so when you can actually see that it is in pain, that means it is serious., Look in the dog's mouth for signs of inflammation and infection. This can include red and puffy gums or discolored teeth. It can also include pus or discharge coming from the gums.If you see any problems in your dog's mouth, then you should take the dog to a veterinarian for evaluation.\\n Call your veterinarian and make an appointment to get your dog's teeth looked at. At the appointment your veterinarian is likely to first ask you a variety of questions about your dog's symptoms and when they began. He or she will then proceed to look at your dog's teeth and assess their condition.\\n\\n\\nMany dogs are resistant to letting a stranger, or even their owners, look in their mouths. Because of this, your veterinarian may need to give your dog a sedative or have you help restrain the dog while they look in its mouth.\\n If your veterinarian thinks that there may be a problem with your dog's teeth, then they will probably suggest a dental cleaning exam that will allow them to get a better look at the dental problems. A professional dental cleaning includes a thorough examination and x-rays of the teeth and jaw. This will allow the veterinary dentist to understand the extent of the disease and how best he or she should proceed with treatment.Your dog will need to be put under anesthesia to have their teeth completely assessed and cleaned.\\nIf the dental disease is mild, treatment will only require the removal of buildup and polishing of the teeth.Your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary dentist if he or she thinks the condition needs a specialist for treatment.\\n In some cases of periodontal disease, the tooth cannot be saved and the best treatment is to have the diseased tooth taken out. In cases where the infection is just in the tooth, and not down in the jaw, this will eliminate the infection.Tooth extraction requires that your dog be put under anesthesia.\\n If the dental disease is so advanced that the infection is in the dog's jaw, then removal of the teeth may not be enough to eliminate the infection. If the infection goes into the jaw, a veterinary surgeon will need to go down into the jaw to remove diseased tissue and debris.If the tooth can be saved, then the surgeon will do a process called \"open root planing\" in order to get down into the infected area without removing the tooth.\\n There are some risk factors that may increase the chance of your dog getting dental disease. These include:Age: Older dogs are more likely to get dental disease.\\nChewing habits: Eating soft food instead of hard kibble can increase the chance of gingivitis build up\\nTooth alignment: Small breeds and short-muzzled breeds often have teeth that are tightly together, promoting food and bacteria to stay in the teeth.\\n The earlier in life you start cleaning your dog's teeth, the more your dog will be used to it and the healthier its teeth will be. Even a puppy that has baby teeth can have its teeth cleaned, if only to get it used to the process.Start the process by getting your puppy used to having your hands near it mouth.\\n Dental disease is entirely preventable if you clean your dog's teeth regularly. Take the time to brush your dog's teeth so that your dog does not have to go through the pain and discomfort of dental disease.It is recommended that you brush your dog's teeth daily.However, any amount that you can do to help to eliminate plaque and gingivitis is better than nothing.\\n If you are concerned about dental disease, or your dog has a history of dental disease, then you may want to consider feeding it a diet that is specially formulated to help with dental health. You can also give special treats that are chews that help clean the teeth.While neither of these options should be used as your dog's only dental care, they have been shown to benefit a dog's dental health.\\n If you are unable to clean your dog's teeth regularly, perhaps due to your dog's resistance to the process, then you should get its teeth professionally cleaned. Have your dog's teeth assessed when it gets veterinary treatment or a check up and discuss whether and when teeth cleaning should occur.Your veterinarian should be able to do this process or can refer you to a veterinary dentist who specializes in this kind of treatment.</td>\n",

You also can enter into an agreement with someone else to do any of those things for you.However, if someone does any of those things without your consent, they have infringed your copyright and you have the right to sue them for damages. You also can get an injunction – a court order that requires the infringer to stop copying or using your work.Copyright protects the words, sounds, or images themselves, but not the ideas they embody or the processes they describe.For example, if you create a training video for your employees, you could register your copyright in that video. If someone copied your video and put it on the internet, that would constitute copyright infringement. However, it would not be copyright infringement if another business owner created his own training video, even if it discussed similar processes.\\nComputer programs can be protected by copyright as literary works, but the copyright protects the code sequences themselves – think of the code as a language like English, but read by computers rather than people – not the program's functions or processes. Application processes or systems can be protected by a patent.You also should keep in mind that copyright generally doesn't protect single words, names, mottos or short phrases. If you have a brief phrase you use in connection with your business, you may be able to trademark it, but copyright would not apply., You will need to disclose information about yourself and your copyrighted work.\\n\\n\\nRegistration basically is a legal formality, since your work is protected by copyright from the moment you create it. However, you must have a registered copyright to file an infringement suit in federal court.If you're filing online, you will be asked some brief questions about the work you're filing before you proceed. Once you start your application, you must enter information such as the type of work, the title of the work, whether and when it has been published, and the names of the authors of the work., The U.S. Copyright Office allows registration to be done either online, or by mailing in a paper application.\\n\\n\\nFiling online provides a number of benefits, including faster processing time and a lower filing fee.If you file online, you only have to pay either $35 or $55 to file your application. The lower rate applies to registration of a single work by one author.When filing online, you can save your application whenever you want and return to it later. Your application will only be submitted after you've paid the filing fee and clicked the button to submit your work.If you'd prefer to file paper forms, you can download them from the Copyright Office website. You must include a filing fee of $85 with your paper application. Some types of copyrights such as serial registrations or works by multiple authors may have a higher filing fee.Processing will take approximately eight months if you file your application online, and can take up to 13 months if you mail in a paper application. If you file online, you have the additional benefit of being able to check the status of your application whenever you want., To complete registration, you must deposit copies of your work.\\n\\n\\nIf you file your application online, you may be able to upload electronic copies of your work directly into the system.If your work has been published in the United States, you are required to send two physical copies for use by the Library of Congress within three months of publication. This deposit is separate from the registration deposit requirements, but you can use the same copies to satisfy both requirements in some circumstances. Failure to make the Library of Congress deposit doesn't affect the status of your registration, but it can lead to fines or other penalties., Although the Copyright Office registers copyrights, it does not enforce them. It is your responsibility to detect and go after infringing uses of your work.\\n\\n\\nCopyright protection endures for the life of the author plus 70 years. If you file your copyright and list a corporate entity as the author, protection will last 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.If you own a website or blog where you publish your work, there are applications available that will scan the internet for copies of your work.Some of these services may charge a fee, so you should compare them so you can choose the maximum amount of protection that will fit your budget.\\nIf you find someone infringing your work, take action immediately. Find out the name and contact information of the infringer and send them a letter letting them know that you have a registered copyright in the work and their use is infringing.You can ask them to cease and desist their infringing use, but you also may want to give them the opportunity to work out an agreement with you to license the work.</td>\n",
